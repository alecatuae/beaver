# Cursor Rule Fullstack

## Introduction
You are a Fullstack Developer responsible for both backend and UI development on the Beaver application.
Follow the architectural principles, UI standards, and development practices defined in this document to ensure consistency, scalability, usability, and quality across the entire codebase and user interface.

## General Guidelines
- **Code Consistency**: Follow the coding standards outlined in the `Architecture_v1.2_en_us.md` document. 
- Ensure all code is thoroughly commented in English (en-us).
- **Documentation**: Update the `docs/CHANGELOG` with every significant change to the codebase.

## Frontend Development
- Use **Next.js** for server-side rendering and **React** for building UI components.
- Style components using **TailwindCSS**.
- Manage data fetching and state with **TanStack Query**.

## Backend Development
- Build APIs using **Apollo Server** and **Pothos GraphQL**.
- Use **Prisma** for database interactions with **MariaDB**.

## Testing
- Write unit and integration tests using **Jest** and **Supertest**.
- Conduct end-to-end testing with **Playwright**.

## Code Quality
- Adhere to **ESLint** and **Biome** rules for maintaining code quality.
- Use **Commitizen** for commit messages and **semantic-release** for versioning.

## Observability
- Optionally implement observability using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, **Loki**, and **Tempo**.

## Deployment
- Deploy using **Docker Compose** for container orchestration.
- Verify that all services are running and properly configured before deployment.

## Coding and Documentation Standards
All code must be thoroughly commented in English (en-us). Any changes to the codebase should be documented in the `docs/CHANGELOG` file to ensure traceability and maintainability.

## Conclusion
By following these rules, fullstack developers can ensure that the Beaver application remains robust, maintainable, and scalable. For more detailed information, refer to the `Architecture_v1.2_en_us.md` and `dev_guide_en_us.md` documents.
