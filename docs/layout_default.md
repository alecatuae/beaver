# Usability and Interface Standards for Beaver Layout

## 1. UX Principles (User Experience)

- **Visual Consistency:**
  - Maintain the same typography family, border styles, icons, and buttons across all screens.
  - Apply consistent spacing logic (padding and margins) for sections, menus, and content areas.

- **Clear Hierarchy:**
  - Visually prioritize important elements (e.g., Title, Active Menu Item, Primary Actions).
  - Differentiate font weights (e.g., bold for section titles, regular for standard items).

- **Focus on Readability:**
  - Minimum font size of 16px for texts.
  - Minimum contrast ratio of 4.5:1 between text and background (WCAG standard).

- **Visual Feedback:**
  - Provide **immediate feedback** on clicks, loading, environment changes, or selections (e.g., soft animation, subtle loading spinner, button highlights).

- **Obvious Priority Actions:**
  - Primary buttons (e.g., Update, Save, Confirm) must visually stand out from secondary actions.

- **Minimalism Oriented to Function:**
  - Remove any visual elements that do not help the user achieve a practical goal on the screen.

## 2. UI Guidelines (User Interface)

- **Typography:**
  - Use a modern, sans-serif font (e.g., Inter, Roboto, Poppins).
  - Suggested sizes:
    - Main Title (Header): 24px to 32px
    - Menu Items: 16px to 18px
    - Auxiliary Text (Footer): 12px to 14px

- **Spacing and Margins:**
  - Minimum 24px spacing between main sections (Sidebar, Content, Footer).
  - 16px internal padding inside cards, menus, or input fields.

- **Colors and Contrast:**
  - Use a soft, professional color palette (based on Beaver palette).
  - Avoid overly saturated colors; prefer soft or muted tones.
  - Highlight active menu item with a differentiated color and **subtle rounded border**.

- **Buttons and Actions:**
  - Rounded corners for buttons (`border-radius: 8px`).
  - Light hover animation: color or subtle shadow change (`transition: all 0.2s ease`).

- **Icons:**
  - Consistent icon style: either all outlined or all filled (never mixed).
  - Fixed size between 20px and 24px.
  - Minimum 8px distance between icon and text.

## 3. Specific Components of Beaver Layout

| Component          | UX/UI Standard |
|:-------------------|:---------------|
| **Header**         | Compact, symmetrical spacing, focus on title and quick actions. |
| **Sidebar**        | Aligned icons, comfortable spacing, clear active item highlight. |
| **Content Area**   | Clean white area, prepared to display future dynamic content. |
| **Footer**         | Discreet information on the left, grouped quick links on the right, fluid responsiveness. |

## 4. Interactive Behaviors

- **Hover:** Color change or light shadow.
- **Focus:** Highlight fields or buttons for keyboard navigation.
- **Loading States:** Subtle loading indicator during asynchronous operations.
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Sidebar collapses to icons on mobile.
  - Footer content stacks vertically on smaller screens.

## 5. General Aesthetics

- Appearance should be **light**, **clean**, and **professional**.
- Apply **8px rounded corners** to cards, menus, and buttons.
- Avoid harsh (sharp) borders.
- Apply **soft shadows** (e.g., `box-shadow: 0px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05)`) to create visual depth without cluttering the interface.

## 6. Wireframe Guidelines

### General Layout and Structure
- Use a well-defined three-column grid layout: fixed sidebar (left), flexible content area (center), and collapsible details panel (right)
- Implement responsive grid maintaining balanced proportions across different resolutions
- Maintain consistent spacing between elements following the 8px principle (or multiples) for margins and padding
- Establish clear visual hierarchy with darker sidebar background for visual separation from content

### Specific Wireframe Components

#### Sidebar (Navigation Bar)
- Place Beaver logo with custom icon at the top
- Implement vertical navigation menu with icon + text for each section
- Highlight active item with purple background color and differentiated icon
- Include menu items: Home, Arch Overview, ADR Management, Impact Workflow, Glossary, Components, Team Management, System Settings, Logs
- Provide each item with a contextually relevant icon
- Apply visual emphasis to active item with background color, side indicator, and stronger typography
- Design inactive items with standard styling and visual change on hover

#### Header (Top Bar)
- Include environment selector dropdown (labeled "Ambiente")
- Add icons for settings and theme toggle (light/dark)
- Place logout/profile button in the upper right corner
- Position page title "Arch Overview" immediately below the main header
- Ensure page title is clearly visible for user orientation
- Provide quick access to global settings and adjustments
- Maintain consistency with familiar navigation patterns

#### Main Content Area
- Design for architecture diagram visualization in the center
- Show visual representation of connections between Internet, Firewall, Server, and Storage components
- Label connections with protocols (443/TCP, NVMe/TCP)
- Represent nodes with contextual icons inside circles
- Use directional arrows on connection lines to indicate flow direction
- Include side toolbar with zoom controls (+ and -) and view options
- Add diagram download/export button
- Place search area at the top for component filtering
- Design relationship table at bottom showing component connections
- Organize table columns as: Component Origin, Relationship, Component Destination
- Structure data with connection types and associated protocols

#### Right Details Panel
- Add search field at the top
- Create "Components" section with highlighted header
- Design expandable dropdown for "Firewall" showing details
- Include collapsed dropdowns for "Storage" and "Internet"
- Display detailed information for selected component (Firewall)
- Organize component metadata in key-value pairs:
  - owner: Network Team
  - environment: Production
  - description: Border Firewall
  - type: Firewall
  - category: Security
  - status: active

#### Footer
- Place Beaver logo in the left corner
- Include copyright information "Â© 2025 Beaver. All rights reserved"
- Add credit text "Developed by Alexandre Nascimento | alecatuae@gmail.com"
- Organize quick links in two columns: "QUICK LINKS" and "SUPPORT"
- Include links to Home, Explorer, Documentation, and GitHub
- Use light gray background for visual separation from content
- Balance the two-column structure
- Make contact information and credits clearly visible

### Visual Representation
- Use predominantly neutral color tones (white, light gray, dark gray)
- Apply purple (primary color) to active/interactive elements
- Make conscious use of white space for visual breathing room
- Maintain consistency with monochromatic icons
- Implement typographic hierarchy between titles, subtitles, and content
- Use sans-serif font for better legibility in digital interfaces
- Apply weight variations (normal/bold) to create contrast and hierarchy

### Interactivity Considerations
- Design sidebar items to change style on hover and click
- Allow dropdowns in the right panel to expand/collapse on click
- Enable central diagram interactions like zoom, pan, and node selection
- Make diagram nodes selectable to display details in the right panel
- Create implicit breadcrumbs through navigation structure
- Provide visual feedback through highlighted elements
- Establish clear hierarchical structure to facilitate mental model understanding

### Usability and Accessibility
- Design intuitive layout following established management interface patterns
- Ensure adequate contrast between text and background
- Size interactive elements sufficiently for comfortable interaction
- Provide clear visual feedback for active and selected elements
- Organize information logically respecting proximity and grouping principles

## Summary of Best Practices

- Consistency across all elements.
- Strong visual hierarchy.
- Clear and immediate user feedback.
- Intuitive, elegant, and functional design.
- Focused clarity on relevant content.
- Predictable and consistent interactions.
- Responsive adaptation for different devices.

## Final Note

If needed, transform these standards into:
- A `.md` file for documentation.
- A practical implementation checklist for developers.
- A basic "Style Guide" for the Beaver project.

Prioritize clarity, readability, visual comfort, and consistent spacing in every part of the interface.
